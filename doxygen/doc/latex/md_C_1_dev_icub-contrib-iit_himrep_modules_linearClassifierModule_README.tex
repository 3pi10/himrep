This module needs {\ttfamily liblinear} compiled and for your convenience you can find it here in the {\ttfamily liblinear-\/1.\+91} folder.

Compile the library from within the directory where the corresponding {\ttfamily cmakefile} is located and then set the environment variable {\ttfamily L\+I\+B\+S\+V\+M\+L\+I\+N\+\_\+\+D\+IR} pointing there.
